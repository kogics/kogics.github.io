Partners-in-Education (PiE) is a program started by the Kogics Foundation with the aim of developing and fostering a partnership between underprivileged schools, primarily in the rural areas in and around Dehradun, and private schools, businesses, corporates, NGOs, and individuals -- in an effort to enhance the quality of education in the rural schools,
and to provide good exposure to the rural kids -- so that they become better equipped to progress in todayâ€™s world.
