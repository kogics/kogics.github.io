The Kojo Kalpana project has been conceptualized by our partners [REACHA](www.reacha.org) and **SmartGaon**, and aims to make the full benefits of Kojo/coding available to participating schools - aligned with NEP 2020 -- where students of classes 6th to 8th (and other classes as desired) can learn *21st century skills through coding* and *learning with understanding* via **Kojo**.

Currently, fifteen schools in four states are enrolled.

To get a flavor of the project, check out the *award ceremony* presentations for some of the coding competitions that have been conducted:

* [August 2022 Kojo coding Competition](/assets/pdf/Aug-2022-competition.pdf)
* [December 2022 Kojo coding Competition](/assets/pdf/Dec-2022-competition.pdf)
