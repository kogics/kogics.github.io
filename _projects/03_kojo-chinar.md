This project is being run by [REACHA](www.reacha.org) in partnership with the Indian Army, with the support of ONGC.

The following are the goals of the project:
* Get youngsters to learn essential 21st century skills through coding, to make them ready for jobs of the future.
* To provide them opportunities for entrepreneurship -- based on the creation of merchandise that involves the printing of coding-based generative art on things like t-shirts, caps, mugs, etc.
* Train youngsters to become coding instructors. This has a couple of big benefits:
  * It helps to jumpstart the coding initiative in schools (aligned with NEP 2020) by providing a good workforce of trained coding instructors.
  * It provides good livelihood opportunities for these youngsters in a potentially high growth area.
