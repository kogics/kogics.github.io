CSR projects are a powerful way to bring the benefits of Kojo/coding to children across Bharat/India -- to enable them to learn essential skills for the 21st century, aligned with NEP 2020.

For Kojo CSR project implementations, [REACHA](https://www.reacha.org) is our exclusive partner, with mentorship for these projects being provided by Lalit Pant, the Kojo Creator and Lead Developer. Lalit is also the Managing Trustee of the Kogics Foundation, and a Member of the REACHA board. There is no financial consideration in this partnership between REACHA and Kogics Foundation.
