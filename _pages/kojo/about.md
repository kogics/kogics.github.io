Kojo is our [open source](https://github.com/litan/kojo) learning environment that is available as a [desktop-app](/kojo-download) for Linux, Windows, and Mac, and as a [web-app](http://ikojo.in) that runs on any modern internet-browser.

Inside Kojo, youngsters (from ages 8 to 80!) – *play*, *create*, and *learn*:

* They **play** with Scala programs
* They **create** drawings, generative-art, animations, music, games, simulations, apps, and Arduino based intelligent circuits (with appropriate additional hardware)
* And they **learn**, *through the act of creation*, these essential 21st century skills:
  * Logical, Critical, and Creative thinking
  * Fundamental ideas in Computing
  * Problem solving
  * Self assessment
  * Attention-fullness, focus, and concentration
  * Design thinking
  * Communication and Collaboration
  * Emotional grit
  * Proficiency with core subject areas:
    * Math and Physics
    * Artificial intelligence
  * And a lot more...

</div>

* Very importantly, in addition to essential skills, they also learn how to learn with understanding – given the opportunity to apply learned ideas to many different situations, and the exploration, discovery, and creation involved in this process.

All of this fosters in them a mindset of experimentation, innovation, self-reliance, growth, mental discipline, and teamwork – with Kojo as the enabler.

If you are curious to see what you can do with Kojo, check out the [Kojo Code Exchange](https://codex.kogics.net/), where students and teachers from around the world share their Kojo creations.


To enable all of the above, Kojo provides a combination of three compelling features that make it a very effective learning environment:
* A strong yet beginner-friendly programming language named Scala (which has great support for all the essential ideas in computing and coding – via structured, functional, object-oriented, and concurrent programming).
* A powerful and easy-to-use App (with modern features like syntax-highlighting, code-completion, interactive-program-manipulation, breakpoints, data inspection, tracing, history, etc.)
* Rich areas for programming and creation (with real-world connects) – Turtle Graphics, Picture Graphics, Animations, [Gaming](https://github.com/litan/kojo-gaming), [Music](https://github.com/litan/kojo-music), [AI](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-3), and [Robotics](https://github.com/litan/kojo-arduino), with good starter learning material.
