Inside Kojo, youngsters (from ages 8 to 80!) – play, create, and learn:
* They play with Scala programs.
* They create drawings, animations, games, and Arduino based intelligent circuits (with appropriate additional hardware).
* And they learn:
  * Logical, Critical, and Creative thinking
  * Computer programming and Computing
  * Problem solving
  * Attention-fullness, focus, and concentration
  * Game development
  * Artificial intelligence
  * Electronics and Robotics
  * Math and Physics
  * Emotional grit
  * Collaboration
  * And a lot more...
* Very importantly, they also learn how to learn with understanding – given the opportunity to apply learned ideas to many different situations, and the exploration, discovery, and creation involved in this process.

All of this fosters in them a [mindset of experimentation](http://ikojo.in), innovation, self-reliance, growth, mental discipline, and teamwork – with Kojo as the enabler.

To get going with Kojo:
