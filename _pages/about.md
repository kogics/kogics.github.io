At the Kogics Foundation, we work with young minds and aim to:
* Give them tools that make learning fun and effective.
* Ignite them with the fire of curiosity.
* Encourage them to dream, and help them to pursue their dreams.
* Guide them to an awareness of joy.

Our core product is [Kojo](/kojo), an app where children **Play** (with code), **Create** (drawings, generative-art, games, simulations, ai-apps, circuits, robots, and more), and **Learn** (essential 21st century skills).

Kojo has been around since late 2009. From the time of its launch, it has been downloaded and used joyfully by people from all over the world. To find out more about this journey, you can go to the [Kojo case studies page](https://docs.kogics.net/reference/kojo-case-studies.html), where you will find interviews, articles, and papers based on the use of Kojo by different people, in different settings, over this period of time. These references provide details on the origin and history of Kojo, the pedagogical ideas behind, its features, and its beneficiaries. They also highlight some of the human interest stories of this journey.

At this point in time, Kojo is a family of products:
* A [desktop app](/kojo) (the original product)
* A [web app](http://ikojo.in)
* The [code exchange](https://codex.kogics.net)
* Many rich and powerful plugins for Kojo:
  * [kojo-ai](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-3)
  * [kojo-gaming](https://github.com/litan/kojo-gaming)
  * [kojo-music](https://github.com/litan/kojo-music)


With the Kojo product as a foundation, we enable many projects in collaboration with partners -- with schools and institutions around India and the rest of the world. You can read more about these on the [Projects](/projects) page.

In addition to our Kojo projects, we are also doing a foundational education project called [Partners in Education (PiE)](/projects/51_pie/).
