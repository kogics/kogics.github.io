Kogics Foundation is a Dehradun based nonprofit organisation (NGO) that has been committed to the field of education and educational technology for more than a decade. At the Kogics Foundation, we strive to:
* Equip young minds with tools that make learning both enjoyable and effective.
* Spark curiosity and a lifelong love of discovery in them.
* Encourage children to dream big and support them in pursuing their dreams.
* Guide them towards an awareness of joy in learning and life.

Our core product is [Kojo](/kojo), an app where children **Play** (with code), **Create** (drawings, generative-art, games, simulations, AI apps, circuits, robots, and more), and **Learn** (essential 21st century skills, including **computational thinking**, **AI** creation and usage, and design thinking).

Kojo has been around since late 2009. From the time of its launch, it has been downloaded and used joyfully by people from all over the world. To find out more about this journey, you can go to the [Kojo case studies page](https://docs.kogics.net/reference/kojo-case-studies.html), where you will find interviews, articles, and papers based on the use of Kojo by different people, in different settings, over this period of time. These references provide details on the origin and history of Kojo, the pedagogical ideas behind, its features, and its beneficiaries. They also highlight some of the human interest stories of this journey.

At this point in time, Kojo is a family of products:
* A [desktop app](/kojo) (the original product)
* A [web app](http://ikojo.in)
* The [code exchange](https://codex.kogics.net)
* Many rich and powerful plugins for Kojo:
  * [Kojo AI](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-3)
  * [Kojo Gaming](https://github.com/litan/kojo-gaming)
  * [Kojo Music](https://github.com/litan/kojo-music)


With the Kojo product as a foundation, we enable many projects in collaboration with partners -- with schools and institutions around India and the rest of the world. You can read more about these on the [Projects](/projects) page.

In addition to our Kojo projects, we are also doing a foundational education project called [Partners in Education (PiE)](/projects/51_pie/).
