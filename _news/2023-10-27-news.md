Two laptops (*core i3 with 4GB RAM*) were gifted to Mother Dreams School, Herbertpur.

Mother Dreams School has been a participant in the kojo-roots project since 2015. Their Kojo/coding efforts had run into issues of late due to hardware problems with their computers. The new laptops should help them get their students (especially in grades 5 and 6) going with coding again in a strong manner.
