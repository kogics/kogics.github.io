In October 2023, a children's Scientific Exhibition and Science Drama Competition was held at Shri Guru Ram Rai Paramedical College Padampur, Kotdwar. This was a  block and district level competition organised by SCERT and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. A total of 423 child scientists from all the 15 development blocks of Pauri Garhwal participated in the competition.

The chief guest of the program was ISRO scientist Dr. Deepak Kumar Aggarwal, who was associated with Chandrayaan-3 mission. The program co-coordinator was Block Education Officer Ayazuddin.

Soham Dabral, a student from Atal Utkristh Government Intermediate College, Devikhet, Pauri Garhwal, coded a **Chandrayaan-3 Moon Lander game** through Kojo for the competition, and secured the first position.

Soham later participated in the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Science Mahotsav-2023 in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, and secured the second position in this state level competition.
